# Face-Detection-using-Haar-Cascade-FrontalFace-Algorithm-and-OpenCV

âœ… Description
Successfully completed a computer vision project where I implemented real-time face detection using the Haar Cascade FrontalFace algorithm with OpenCV in Python.

The system captures live video feed from a webcam, detects faces using a pre-trained haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml classifier, and saves grayscale cropped face images into a structured dataset for future model training or recognition tasks.

ðŸ“Œ Key Features:

Used OpenCV to access webcam and process live image frames.

Applied Haar Cascade to detect facial coordinates.

Cropped and resized detected faces to standardized dimensions (130x100 px).

Automatically stored 180 grayscale face images into a user-specific directory.

Used os to handle file paths and folder creation dynamically.

This project not only strengthened my practical understanding of image processing and real-time computer vision but also laid the groundwork for future projects like facial recognition and emotion detection.
